<p>HTML - HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages and structure their content. It consists of a series of elements or tags that define the structure and layout of a web document.</p>
<p>CSS - CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used in conjunction with HTML to control the presentation and styling of web pages. CSS separates the content and structure (defined by HTML) from the visual style, layout, and design of a web page.</p>
